# Kindao - Decentralized Fact-Check
Kindao is a decentralized fact-checking platform built on Web3. It allows users to submit claims or information for verification by a network of validators.

Each action of yours gets recorded on the blockchain, including your answers and upvotes.

There's a bounty attached to the proposal. The bounty is KDAO token determined by the proposer, which will be distributed between the best fact-checkers.

Users can create proposals. Proposals contain information you want to verify. For example, if you want to know if Earth is flat, you must create a proposal. Proposals have 3 parts:

- Title
- Description
- Bounty

After you enter a title for your proposal, you should start explaining your proposal. And lastly, you must enter a bounty. The currency of the bounty is the KDAO token. The top 3 users who have the most votes get the bounty. Bounty is distributed according to their upvote counts.
